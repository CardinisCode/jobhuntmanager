# Project Hunt Manager: Technical Readme
This technical readme goes into more detailed look at how each function works & which Repositories each function connects to. 

To be clear this technical Readme only looks at the application's functions found in the following directories:
-   Forms
-   Repo
-   Services
-   Templates

Due to how big this file got, I've separated this readme into 4 md files, each focusing on one of the above directories.
