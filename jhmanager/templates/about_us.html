                The Job Hunt Manager is a web-application where you can store all matters related to job hunting:
                <ul>
                    <li> Job Applications</li>
                    <li> Upcoming Interviews</li>
                    <li> Interview Preparation </li>
                    <li> Take Notes </li>

            <label> Why? </label>
            <p class="paragraph"> 
                As completion to the current Computer Science course, I was asked to design something that I believed would add value to a community of my choice. 
                It could be a web application / phone application / or game, as long as I designed & developed it to completion. 
                Although it was possible to co-develop this application with a fellow student, I found connecting with fellow students, during Covid19, to be rather challenging. 
                So I designed & developed this entire application myself. 
            </p>
            <label> Language: </label>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Over the past two years of self-teaching (with the mentoring from my partner), I've developed a passion for developing in Python. 
                Although it may have been easier to use Django, I decided to rather use (and stick to) Flask. It gave me a lot of flexibility & challenges alike. 
                I used WTForms for all the Forms - it was delightful and fairly easy to use. 
            </p>
            <label> Challenges:</label>
            <div> 
                <p class="paragraph"> 
                    I think of all the challenges I've come across, when developing this application, I think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep" class="link-alt-colour">Scope-creep</a> has been the hardest. I have yet to master it! 
                    Despite having a good idea of what I wanted to achieve, I quickly realised that the scope was far beyond the scope needed for this project. 
                    In fact, I could easily continue developing the application years into the future. 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph"> 
                    So I've decided to designate this application to be a pilot / proof concept, with the hope I can develop this application into a fully operational application in time.

            <p class="paragraph"> 
                Before I even started working on the development for this application, I decided to actually find out if fellow job hunters would use such an application. 
            </p>
            <label> My research methods:</label>
            <p class="paragraph">
                <ol> 
                    <li> Informally asked fellow job hunters on the Whatsapp job hunting groups if they would use the application. </li>
                    <li> Put together a Google form and posted it both in the Whatsapp groups & on Linkedin.</li>
                    <li> I asked a recruiter on Linkedin, who hires within the IT field. </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <label> Sample Size:</label> 9 people
            <br/>
            <label> Results:</label>
            <p> I received strong support for the application from everyone I asked. What each person wanted from the application did vary, as can be expected.</p>
