# Project Hunt Manager

## Video Demo:  <URL HERE>

## Description: 
A web-based application for any one looking to manage their job hunting. Its intended to be a place where a user can store job applications, interviews, interview preparation, notes, & contacts. Plus the user can add companies from their wishlist. 

The application uses Python, Flask, WTForms, HTML, CSS & a little JavaScript. 

I have narrowed down the application for fellow software engineers, so the Job application form is very much in the scope of the software engineering industry. 

## Pages:

### Layout: 
The general layout for all html templates, which is referenced to by all the remaining html templates. 

### About us:
This page tells/informs the user:
- what this application is about, 
- why I developed this application, 
- the research I carried out before putting this application together,
- security, & 
- how they could contact me if they want to. 


### Forms: 
All the below mentioned forms are created using Flask WTForms:

#### Add Job Application (Form):
A form to add a job application, with all the details of a regular job application. 

#### Add Application Note (Form):
A form to add a note for a specific application, which is useful at any stage of the job application. 

#### Add Job Offer (Form): 
Allows user to add a job offer received, and is linked to a job application. 

#### Add Company (Form):
Allows user to create the company profile for a company on the user's wishlist. This will create a company 'contact', where the user can also gather research, make notes or create a job application. 

#### Add Company Note (Form):
A form to add a note for a specific company, which can be accessed at any point from the company's profile. 

#### Add Company Job Application (Form):
A form to add a job application for a specific company. It is like the 'add job application' form but without the company details section.
