# To check whether your current version of SQLite supports foreign key constraints or not, you use the following command.
```
    PRAGMA foreign_keys;
```

# The command returns an integer value: 1: enable, 0: disabled. If the command returns nothing, it means that your SQLite version doesnâ€™t support foreign key constraints.

# To disable foreign key constraint:
```
    PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF;
```

# To enable foreign key constraint:
```
    PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
```
